## DSP Project: Age Estimation
#### The project goal is to find the most efficient model to estimate human age using a different initialization method and fundamental components of the layers in a neural network for model training.
## Instruction:
#### Download Kaggle API for download the dataset.
#### Place '.ipynb' file in Google Colab.
#### Use 'Run all' to see the result and detail of the model.
